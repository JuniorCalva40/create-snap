### Recommendations

The project structure is unopinionated, but itâ€™s beneficial to follow the recommended pattern [Visit Here](https://github.com/delvedor/fastify-example/tree/main)
, which consists of two top-level folders: **plugins** and **routes**.

- **plugins/**: This folder contains shared code that can be utilized across your entire application, such as authentication and rate limiting functionality.
- **routes/**: This folder houses the business logic of your application, including the redirect logic and the APIs for admin operations.

Feel free to adopt this structure, or customize your own project organization to fit your needs! ðŸ™‚
